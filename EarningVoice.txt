Earning Voice

Earning voice is an old bulletin board /text chat metaphor. In earlier days,
you would lurk for some time on a conversation, and then someone would grant
you "voice," which means that you can answer or ask questions or converse
with the group.

If you did not behave according to the rules of the conversation or mores
of the the moderators, then you would have voice taken away. You would have
to merely lurk until someone felt like investing in hearing you.

We talk about this phenomenon in teams and groups, that some of them
require the new member to "earn voice" -- and this applies even if the 
new member is a highly-paid and well-known coach.

Often we're lucky because we get some immediate "free voice" in our 
groups. Often we're invited. But the concept still remains.

I wonder to what extent ideas and concepts and principles have to "earn voice"
and to what extent we extend them "free voice" when they resonate clearly with
ideas we already know to be true.

Do ideas have to fit in with the crowd the same way new people do?
