The idea of "pull" in lean is that you pull from upstream sources
and you create a queue for downstream to pull from. Rather than
cramming work and materials from the front of the queue, we pull
from the rear.

I've seen this work in operating a Kanban board. If you concentrate
on the "done" column first, then you're always trying to find a way
to reduce WIP and get more delivered product.  Too many people focus
on the left column, and start by pushing as much as possible into 
WIP, clearing WIP in order to make room to push more. 

This year, Amr and I were teaching in Abingdon, UK for Schlumberger
when it became clear that the "constraint" in a process was the 
inventory queue closest to the receiving customer. If you elevate
that constraint, you automagically get more flow. Then the next
most-upstream queue is taken.

This is nice, because it's a focusing activity. It's great because
subsequent changes will not re-do or undo the work you do downstream.

Eventually you will have great flow inside the pipe, but you'll see 
inventory piled up either before or after the pipe (maybe both).

I think this is so simple and should be obvious once you know it.
It seems profound in its simplicity.
