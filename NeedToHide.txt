In the best of times, when we are feeling smart and brave and
honest and good, we are able to move with impunity into all
kinds of circumstances. 

However, sometimes we feel the urge to hide from people. We
want a way to pretend we didn't see the email, or were away
from the phone, or on a call with someone else.

When we feel afraid to talk to people in our organization, or
in the client organization, we can see it as a trigger. 

It indicates a feeling of shame or obligation.

It happens to me when I feel that I'm not making progress.

It happens to me when I feel that my time is not being spent
well, whether it is my fault (it sometimes is) or not (as it
sometimes isn't).

It comes sometimes when I feel the person on the other end may
be disappointed. 

It comes sometimes when the work I need to do for them is work
I don't much enjoy (sales, marketing, scheduling, pricing) and
I want to be doing more creative development work. 

I can pretend I don't feel like hiding, but that's not very 
productive. I can "gut it out" and bury my feelings for a
while, but that's not very healthy.

I need to see this as a trigger, and find the habit that 
opens up the blockage so I can move on and get work done.

Some of the cure may be to intentionally develop competence
in those areas where I feel weak. Some of it may be to have
a more simple work system so that I don't have to spend a
lot of emotional energy on being wrong and making decisions
or feeling that I have to "out-maneuver" the person on the
other end.

Some of the cure maybe to always have good progress to report,
or to get better at reporting shallow results, or to build
relationships that don't make me feel afraid to be totally
transparent. 

But in each case, the feeling that I want to hide is a 
trigger that I need to meet and befriend my frustration
and learn what it has to teach me.
