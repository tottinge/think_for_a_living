From David Rock's book /Your Brain At Work/ comes the social threats that shut
down your long-term memory access, short-term memory access, and much of the
reasoning (the "slow" system) of your prefrontal cortex.

Status
Certainty
Autonomy
Relatedness
Fairness

Threats to these social dynamics (fear of losing face, fear of losing a good
working relationship, fear of being controlled) reduce the ability of people 
to engage intellectually with their work.

We don't always get benefit when developers engage emotionally, especially
when the emotion is fear, flight, panic, anger, resentment.
