Sometimes problems don't really exist at all.

This is like the monster children imagine in their closet. Children definitely
will alter their behaviors and even behave inappropriately for fear of the 
closet monster. 

A parent can spend untold hours explaining but it is to no avail.
The parent can look in the closet and pronounce it monster-free,
and that sometimes helps, but kids know that monsters are sneaky
and can hide from adults sometimes. Maybe they have hidden trap
doors!

Eventually, most parents will banish the monster. Some will threaten
it, "No monsters tonight! You know I'm watching you, and if any 
monster comes in here tonight, it's in BIG TROUBLE."

Sometimes they even install a "monster proof" mechanism and charge
it up to keep monsters away.

They know there is no monster.
But they know you argue with a fearful mind.
So they banish the imaginary monster, and all is well.

Sometimes a manager has to do the same. Whether they have ever
been cruel or scary or harsh or not, they may have to come forward
and declare that they've turned over a new leaf and they want to
start extending more trust and autonomy, or listen without 
judging, or work hard to retain good people, or whatever it is
that they've been trying to do for years (but nobody believes).

"Today, we are turning a corner. You developers have not been
given enough voice in our product planning. I realize that has
held you back. From now on, we want your arguments pro/con 
ideas. We want your recommendations. And don't worry about 
the process we have always followed. Even that is up for grabs.
All we ask is that you work to improve value and flow and 
quality. However you do that is okay with us."

Provided they're authentically (ie, teh followthrough matches)
these kinds of pronouncements banish closet monsters. 

The only problem is if the kids see something that looks 
like a monster crawling out of the closet tomorrow night.
