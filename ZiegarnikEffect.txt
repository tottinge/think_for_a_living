"people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks"

Essentially, they feel the incompletedness of things, and will tend
to not want to switch tasks while one is begun and unfinished.

Finished work we can easily forget about.

Zeigarnik is a student of Kurt Lewin (another tie-in!).

There is some unrepeatability for this effect, and some controversy. But
Lewin's idea stands here: "a task that has already been started establishes a
task-specific tension, which improves cognitive accessibility of the relevant
contents." and "in the case of task interruption the reduction of tension 
is being impeded."

Ruud brought up the correlation between this and the cost of task-switching.
