JB Rainsberger has been famously referring to risk as 
likelihood * cost. 


On a forum, he suggested:
    The impulse to "never let this happen again" dominates so easily, so we get
    paid to ask, "What would have to be true for this not to be such a big
    problem next time it happens?"

Notice that this is the wrong kind of safety, the safety from risk.
It may be that the right kind of safety is "affordable consequences."
