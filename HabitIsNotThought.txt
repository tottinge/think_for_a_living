The cool thing about habit is that it is not thought.

    I remember reading somehwere (cite?) about an interview with a fire chief
    about how he makes snap-decisions at the site of a fire. The chief said
    that they could not possibly do their job if they were making conscious
    decisions, and that they function by following frequent and rigorous
    training. 

We often cite the value of a code standard is not needing to decide 
wiether to reformat the code, or where to put the brace, or whether
to talk the the author about which way is better. If it's settled 
already, we don't have to decide.

A simple work system is one with valid pre-made decisions. 

Maybe we don't spend enough time on building habits and settling
premade decisions.  I wonder what amount of our decision-making
capability is wasted on things we could easily have settled.

On the other hand, where we have a habit, we can stop thinking.
How many things do we take as "fixed" because they are habitual
to us or others, but they're entirely changeable if we're 
okay with changing some habits?

Habit is productive (it reduces cognitive load and friction) 
but only productive habits are productive. A habit of poor
hygeine or sloppy thinking or careless decision-making,
of substance abuse or overeating...

Habits are a double-edged sword. They are not virtues
not demons, but rather we need to use them effectively
to gain the results we want from our work/lives.
