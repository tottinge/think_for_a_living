From an email, where I realized that "you should think like an X" is not helpful
if you are not an X and unnecessary if you are an X.

    Maybe IL should teach them? We hear "think like an entrepreneur" a lot, but
    there really aren't a lot of great talks or books or ... maybe... ELEARNING
    to teach that. 

    If it's important, then maybe we should have something. Even if it is too
    small to sell, it could be a pretty big deal.

Yes, it would be fun to teach this, esp. through eLearning.  

I gave a talk called Hackerpreneur in which I went into great depth on this
subject.  There is a lot to mine from that. 

I also see this tied to safety.
