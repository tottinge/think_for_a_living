Does your boss have a right to expect things of you?
Making money for the company?
Being transparent? 
Reporting your work (ouch: this hurts me)?
Contacting customers (double-ouch)
Growing your skills?
Making and keeping promises and agreements?

Is it not right for them to have some kind of expectations of the people they work with?

If it is right, then there should be more cooperation.
