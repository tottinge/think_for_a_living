Comfort and safety

"Feeling safe" and "feeling comfortable" are used as synonyms.  They aren't,
and often are opposed.

A drunk snoozing on a park bench feels neither, but if he were to break into a
neighbor's house and cuddle up on the sofa, he is far more comfortable and far
less safe. 

Likewise, there are safe places he can go which are not more comfortable.

Most of the time, we are "comfortable" where we know the system, we have habits
pre-developed, and we pretty much know what we are doing and who we are around.
It is what CS Lewis termed "affection" -- the love of the familiar.

But our familiar environment may not be the one that is safest for us. 

1. Kids are comfortable throwing their toys on the floor.
2. Some cooks are comfortable leaving dirty dishes all over the kitchen.
3. Teen drivers feel comfortable cruising at 90 on the back roads.
4. People get "comfortable" not using that wobbly hand rail.
5. Addicts are more comfortable when abusing their substances of habit. 
6. Pathological liars are uncomfortable telling the truth. 
7. People like me are uncomfortable exercising.


Sometimes we don't take on safer practices because we fear that they are
uncomfortable, and that discomfort feels like "unsafety."

But to become more safe, we have to shift our comfort zone.
