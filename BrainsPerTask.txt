Partial brain:
    an underloaded brain wanders off, but a little more processing helps.
    an overloaded brain bolts off, and any other distraction is just annoying

Some task are emotionally or intellectually too large to be done well by a single being.

We tend to try to serialize, so one person spends more time only to get a less
good result. 

Maybe by parallelizing, we can have multiple beings until the task is more likely
to be overcome by sheer intellectual or emotional processing power. 

Breaking things down, spending more time, running existing machines (brains)
more efficiently, running more machines -- these get big jobs done.
